# Quaternion-Based Feedback Control for Satellite Attitude Regulation

This project implements a quaternion-based feedback control system for satellite attitude regulation in 3D space. The system is designed for smooth and stable convergence to a desired orientation, avoiding the singularities associated with Euler angle representations.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Model a satellite as a rigid body with full 3D attitude dynamics.
- Implement a feedback controller using quaternion representation.
- Stabilize the satellite's orientation to a specified target attitude.
- Analyze and validate the system through MATLAB/Simulink simulation.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Methods
- MATLAB 
- Simulink
- Spacecraft kinematics
- Quaternion-based feedback regulator

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
The feedback controller achieves stable convergence to the desired quaternion orientation, with minimal steady-state error and smooth rotational transitions. Simulation plots and system responses are included to illustrate performance.
